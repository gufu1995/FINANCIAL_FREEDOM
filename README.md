# Financial Freedom Project

Welcome to the Financial Freedom project! This is where we embark on a journey to build tools and strategies for achieving, well, financial freedom! 

## What's the Goal?

The ultimate goal is to create a suite of applications and resources that empower individuals to:

*   Track their income and expenses.
*   Set financial goals.
*   Analyze investment opportunities.
*   Automate savings and investments.
*   Learn about personal finance.

## Current Status

This project is currently in the **"Idea Incubator"** phase. That means we're brainstorming, experimenting, and laying the groundwork for future development.

## Get Involved!

We welcome contributions of all kinds! Whether you're a seasoned developer, a finance guru, or just someone who's passionate about financial freedom, there's a place for you here.

Here are a few ways to get involved:

*   **Share your ideas:** What features would you like to see in a financial freedom app?
*   **Report bugs:** If you find any issues, please let us know!
*   **Contribute code:** Help us build the core functionality of the project.
*   **Write documentation:** Make it easier for others to understand and use the tools we create.

## Technologies Used

*   [Python](https://www.python.org/)
*   [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) (Maybe? Still deciding!)
*   [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) (Potentially!)
